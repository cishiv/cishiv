Hi,

I spend a lot of my time experimenting with new technology.

I also write on my personal [website](https://shivan.dev).

Professionally, I've spent most of my time around Java, TypeScript and Go.

I've deployed a bunch of projects using Next.js + Vercel, but I've grown tired of the ceremony of it all.

In my free time I currently prefer @ziglang or Go.
